# TEC-1 DaS Board
<H1>(Display and Serial Board)</h1>

his board plugs into the expansion port (and others) of the original Tec-! and gives the user access to an LCD display (either 16x02 or 20x04) that can be used with JMON.

It also gives the capability to do some wicked BitBangin' Serial, with an easy plug in for an FTDI module.

There is a bank of DIP switches that allows input for defaults at startup, like selecting a preferred keyboard layout or enabling and disabling options.

Lastly, it introduces what every TEC-1 should have had from day one; An expansion port that has all the required data lines for easy add-ons.
