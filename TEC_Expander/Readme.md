<h1>TEC-1 Expander</h1>

Since the very first TEC-1 ever made, there has been a conspicous double row of pins at the top right of the PCB that has been the conjecture of many an argument!
  - What was it planned for?
  - Why wasn't it wired up to anything?
  - How could it be used?
  - And when will Mark stop talking about it!?
  
Well the time has come to answer most of these questions with the release of a number of boards that make use of that 2 x 10 pin connector we have all spent countless hours wondering how to make the best use of it, right? (OK, maybe it's just me.)

<h2>TEC Expander 8x8</h2>
First out of the gate is to update and make for a LOT easier to build, the 8x8 LED Matrix. This little cutie uses those ever so cheap and plentiful, single module 64 LED arranged in an 8x8 array. You can pick them up from eBay for $10 or less. Way easer than soldering in 64 LEDs and making pretsels out of their legs.

Two versions of the board will be made: one with the original layout as per the Talking Electronics 8x8, and another version that is coined "byte aligned" since the LSB will be on the RHS of the module, and rows will be counted from the bottom tot he top. Makes sense, right? And apparently this is how the Souther Cross version of the 8x8 was wired. Well done!

<h2>Coming Soonâ„¢</h2>
On the drawing board are a few more PCBs including:
  - A clock / Timing board that will give you an accurate counter and let you know what speed the TEC is running at.
  - A MAX board for further (and wider) LED fun.
  - A 4x20 LCD board
  - An I2C interface board
