<h1>TEC-1 Expander</h1>

Since the very first TEC-1 ever made, there has been a conspicous double row of pins at the top right of the PCB that has been the conjecture of many an argument!
  - What was it planned for?
  - Why wasn't it wired up to anything?
  - How could it be used?
  - And when will Mark stop talking about it!?
  
Well the time has come to answer most of these questions with the release of a number of boards that make use of that 2 x 10 pin connector we have all spent countless hours wondering how to make the best use of it, right? (OK, maybe it's just me.)

<h2>TEC Expander 8x8</h2>
First out of the gate is to update and make for a LOT easier to build, the 8x8 LED Matrix. This little cutie uses thosE ever so cheap and plentiful, single module 64 LED arranged in an 8x8 array. You can pick them up from eBay for $10 or less. Way easer than soldeing in and making pretsels out of the legs.
