This Repository is for all files that relate to the hardware of the TEC-1:
- Any expansion boards suitable for the TEC-1
- Any alternative/derivative motherboards to the TEC-1.
- and possibly any other Z80-based motherboards (eg. SC-1) and their expansionsm, although they should all be grouped in one folder.

<h1>How to Use this Repo</h1>
1. Make a FORK of this Repo to your own account. (You know you want to.)

That's right, make a Fork of this entire Repo back to your account.

Please keep the existing folder structure intact. If it isn't your folder, don't rename it or move it. Leave it be. Or if you don't want it, feel free to delete it from *your* Repo, but then your Pull Request (see below) may be difficult to follow/allow, if they try to remove files from the Master.

<h2>KEEPING UP TO DATE</h2>
When others add to the Repo, you'll probably want an up to date copy. (You don't have to, though.)

1. At the top right of the Repo, you will see a button called "Fetch upstream". Go on, click it...

2. You will be presented with two options, one is to "Compare" and the other is "Fetch and Merge"

3. Click on "Fetch and Merge". (If there are folders you don't care to have, you can dleete them from your own copy of the repo.)

<h2>ADDING TO THE REPO</h2>
When you want to Add or make Changes to the Repo.

1. Create a Folder in *your copy* of the Repo for each board or if it makes sense, group of boards connected to a single project.

2. Do your thing and create the hardware files in that folder; Schematics, Gerbers, documentation, PCB Layouts... Whatever it is you want to share and include into the TEC1group Hardware repository.

3. Once you are done with all your changes and ready to share it with the Group, click on the "Contribute" button and then "Open pull request".

4. A page called "Comparing changes" appears, highlighting the new files you want to add. Again, click on "Create pull request".

5. And yet another page, this time giving you the option to edit the "commit comments" that the Admins of the TEC1group will read before approval of the merge. Last time, click on "Create pull request".

6. You will be taken to the list of Pull Requests for the Repo and see how many are outstanding etc.

7. The admins of the TEC1group will review your changes and as long as you keep the changes to a folder *you* created and maintain, then there is very little reason for them to not accept the changes and pull your work back to the master Repo for all and sundry to share. THANK YOU!
