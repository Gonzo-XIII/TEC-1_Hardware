# TEC-1 Adapter

The current TEC-1F and all its previous incarnations suffer from a difficult and awkward method of expansion, 
namely stacking things on top of the extra memory socket and then using fly leads to connect extra lines like
any Input/Output port select lines, memory select lines or any extras like the M1 on INT lines which are not 
present in a standard 2K memory socket, let alone any extra address lines like the [Matrix Keyboard](https://github.com/Gonzo-XIII/TEC-1_Hardware/tree/master/Matrix_Keyboard) uses.
