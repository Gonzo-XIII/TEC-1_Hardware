# Z80Bus X4 Board

With the release of the Z80Bus Standard, including the KiCAD footprints and Gerbers so people can print their own Z80Bus system board, modules for the TEC-1 and the Souther Cross Computer (SCC) can very quickly and easily be developed that allow the USER to choose how they wish to connect the modules to their machines. Boards designed with the innovative <b>IDC<sup>2</sup></b> connector footprint allow the user to choose to go hippie and continue to use ugly IDC cables with a Vertical IDC Box Header, or with a Right Angled Box Header, they have the ultimate in freedom to connect using IDC cables, <b>Quick-Connect<sup>Â®</sup></b> direct to the TEC-1/SCC, or using the <b>X4 System<b> and have multiple expansions boards all working in unison.

And here is a picture of the PCB that can be sourced from PCBWay (follow the affiliate link below) or buy the entire kit off eBay.
