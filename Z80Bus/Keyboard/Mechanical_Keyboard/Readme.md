For those that are thinking of getting a full travel mechanical keybaord connected to their TEC-1, 
this is the supplier of the case, plate and keys at very good prices. Otherwise, you will have to make
your own case when the time comes.

Case: https://kbdfans.com/products/kbd67-abs-plastic-case  (This is the most important thing to get ASAP)

Key Plate: https://kbdfans.com/products/kbd67-lite-r4-accessories  (Second most important thing, as making these is not easy)

Stabilisers: https://kbdfans.com/products/coming-soon-kbdfans-pc-screw-in-stabilizers  (You need one set of these, in your choice of colour)

Keys: https://kbdfans.com/products/gateron-yellow-switches  (at only 10c each!! You will need 7 packs and will have spares)

They also have all sorts of key caps (including wood!) that go on sale and there are other sources of Cherry MX compatible keycaps on eBay, like these: https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/204166483355
